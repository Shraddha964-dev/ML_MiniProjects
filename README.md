# ML Mini Projects

This repository contains my **machine learning mini projects**. I created these projects to practice ML concepts step by step and to build a strong foundation for entry-level roles.

I am a beginner in machine learning, so each project focuses on **clear logic, simple explanations, and clean code**.

## What this repository includes

* Small end-to-end ML projects
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature selection and scaling
* Model training using scikit-learn
* Model evaluation using common metrics
* Jupyter Notebooks with explanations

Each project is independent and focuses on learning one or two key ML ideas.

## Tools & Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

## Micro Projects

### Python & Machine Learning

* **[Logistic Regression ](https://github.com/Shraddha964-dev/ML_MiniProjects/blob/main/Notebooks/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb):**  Using Logistic Regression to predict whether an internet user clicked an ad or not.

* **[K Nearest Neighbours (KNN)](https://github.com/Shraddha964-dev/ML_MiniProjects/blob/main/Notebooks/ML%20with%20K%20Nearest%20Neighbors.ipynb):**
  Classifies data points into two target classes using a fake dataset. The best value of K is selected using the elbow method.

* **[Decision Trees & Random Forests](https://github.com/Shraddha964-dev/ML_MiniProjects/blob/main/Notebooks/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forests.ipynb):**
  Predicts whether a borrower will pay back their loan using publicly available data from LendingClub.

* **[Machine Learning with Linear Regression](https://github.com/Shraddha964-dev/ML_MiniProjects/blob/main/Notebooks/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb):** Uses a fake e-commerce dataset to analyze customer behavior and predict yearly spending. Helps decide whether the company should focus more on the mobile app or the website.

* **[Support Vector Machine (SVM)](https://github.com/Shraddha964-dev/ML_MiniProjects/blob/main/Notebooks/ML%20with%20Support%20Vector%20Machines.ipynb):** Classifies flowers into different categories using the famous Iris dataset.

* **[Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/Shraddha964-dev/ML_MiniProjects/blob/main/Notebooks/Recommender%20Systems%20with%20Python.ipynb):**
  Builds a recommender system that suggests movies based on similarity between user reviews.

## Why I made these projects

* To understand machine learning from basics
* To practice writing clean and readable notebooks
* To apply theory on real datasets
* To prepare for entry-level Data Analyst / Data Scientist roles

## How to run the projects

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shraddha964-dev/ML_MiniProjects.git
   ```
2. Open Jupyter Notebook
3. Go to any project folder
4. Run the notebook cell by cell

## Future Improvements

* Add more ML algorithms
* Improve feature engineering
* Add model comparison
* Add better visualizations
